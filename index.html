To answer the **most frequently asked question:**
This is first and foremost a *social* club. 
There are a couple other groups on campus you may be interested in:
If you're: 
* stoked about finding an uphill, mountain-oriented group of people, this is the right place! 
* looking to get outside regularly, but mostly interested in bouldering and occasionally sport climbing, check out [Tritons Rock](https://www.instagram.com/tritons_rock/)
* looking for guided, 'everything included' trips, we recommend the [Outback Center's program](https://linktr.ee/ucsdoutbackadventures)
* interested in [competitive climbing](https://www.instagram.com/ucsdclimbingteam/), check out the climbing team
And yes, undergrads and beginners are very much welcome! 


Below are trip reports from our members.
