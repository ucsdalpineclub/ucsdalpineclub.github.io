A loose amalgamation of mountaineers, climbers, backpackers, and other stoked, uphill-oriented outdoorspeople!

Here's what we've been up to, as of late (in video form):

To answer the <b>most frequently asked question:</b> This is first and foremost a <i>social</i> club. 
Confusingly, there are a couple other groups on campus you may have heard of.
If you're: 
<ul>
  <li>stoked about finding an uphill, mountain-oriented group of people, this is the right place!</li>
  <li>looking to get outside regularly, but mostly interested in bouldering and occasionally sport climbing, consider <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tritons_rock/">Tritons Rock</a></li>
  <li>looking for guided, 'everything included' trips, we recommend the <a href="https://linktr.ee/ucsdoutbackadventures">Outback Center's program</a></li>
  <li>interested in competitive climbing, check out the  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsdclimbingteam/">climbing team</a></li>
</ul>
And yes, undergrads and beginners are very much welcome! 


Below are trip reports from our members.
