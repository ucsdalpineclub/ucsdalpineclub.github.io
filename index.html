A loose amalgamation of mountaineers, climbers, backpackers, and other stoked, uphill-oriented outdoorspeople!

Here's what we've been up to, as of late (in video form):

To answer the **most frequently asked question:**
This is first and foremost a *social* club. 
Confusingly, there are a couple other groups on campus you may have heard of.
If you're: 
* stoked about finding an uphill, mountain-oriented group of people, this is the right place! 
* looking to get outside regularly, but mostly interested in bouldering and occasionally sport climbing, consider [Tritons Rock](https://www.instagram.com/tritons_rock/)
* looking for guided, 'everything included' trips, we recommend the [Outback Center's program](https://linktr.ee/ucsdoutbackadventures)
* interested in competitive climbing, check out the [climbing team](https://www.instagram.com/ucsdclimbingteam/)
And yes, undergrads and beginners are very much welcome! 


Below are trip reports from our members.
