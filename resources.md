## Good online resources:
[Mountainproject](https://www.mountainproject.com): Great resource for climbing routes
[Summitpost](https://www.summitpost.org/): Semi-defunct, but maintains good bits of info about mountains.
[CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/map.html): Awesome for planning trips
[Eastern Sierra avalanche forecast](https://www.esavalanche.org/), [socal snow](http://www.socalsnow.org/): For local avvy prognoses. Typically our own in-club beta is more up to date.
[Mountain forecast](https://www.mountain-forecast.com/): NOAA tends to be the most reliable, but the altitude stuff is helpful. As always, make calls at your own risk.

## Mountain sports on the cheap

* European shops are way less expensive than American ones; use this to your advantage! oliunid.com, ekosport, and many, many others are way cheaper, and for big things (boots, skis, etc) can save you hundreds of dollars. This tends to be on the same scale as pro-deals. You can get a full skimo setup for less than 500 if you’re thoughtful.
* The cheapest avalanche course in California is offered by the community college in Tahoe for roughly 80 bucks
* REI returns are extremely generous…
* UCSD Ski Club will give you an extra 200 dollars off on the Ikon pass on top of the student discount if you fill out a form and send them your class schedule. 

## Our favorite local shops and cafes

* Higher grounds in Idyllwild
* Mountain Rambler in Bishop, good spot for partners, especially in winter.
* Looney Bean in Bishop
* Mammoth mountaineering: Best gear shop in California
* Mammoth mountaineering’s used gear shop (Bishop): Sometimes they’ll have exactly what you want.We’ll include some campsites and hot springs soon!
