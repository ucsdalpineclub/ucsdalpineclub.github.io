# FAQs
### What's the vibe?
First and foremost, we are a social club! This is a loose amalgamation of mostly grad students and a few undergrads who are stoked about doing stuff in the mountains. If you're new to the whole thing, that's A-OK -- many of our members got started with this stuff through the club. On the other hand, if you're more experienced, we think this is a really easy way to expand the partner list! 

### Do you do official trips?
We do official trips only about once or twice a quarter, but rest assured, that's because we're busy sending most weekends! 

### What activities do you guys do, exactly?
Pretty much any sport that takes place in the mountains (especially in the backcountry)! We love hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, and mountaineering, but we also do things like ice climb and backcountry ski.


### Wait, you all climb actual mountains? Like, with snow, ropes, and ice axes?
Heck yeah! Come join!

### Are there tryouts?
Absolutely not!

### Are there required meetings?
Nah. We’d love to see you at weekly socials/cardio sessions! If all you want to do is borrow gear though, that’s cool too.

### Are there any fitness requirements?
No, everybody’s welcome! That said, if you are interested in getting stronger, or in developing your cardio, you’re more than welcome to join us for regular training — all levels welcome. Of course, all of these are totally optional.

### I’m not a student at UCSD, can I still join?
Yep! Anyone can join.

### Do I have to have experience to join?
Nope! Even if you’ve never been above sea level, you are more than welcome to join. We’re hoping to be a community for newbies and crusty trad dads alike.

### Is this stuff dangerous?
It can be. However, we try to emphasize safe practices and good preparation. Beyond that, some activities will be inherently more dangerous than others (for example, difficult alpine climbs are more dangerous than a backpacking trip), and it’s important to us that people only do stuff that they want to do and are adequately prepared for.


### Ok, so you ONLY go outside, then?
While we do love this stuff, we also go to the climbing gym regularly for fun and training. You’re welcome to join.

### You all seem sooooo cool and the club sounds like a ton of fun! How do I join?
Sign the waiver, and bring 45 bucks to a meeting! Easy. A bit more info is on the Join page.

### How do I stay informed about upcoming events?
Take a look at our events page.

### Last question: Where do these photos come from?
We take them ourselves!
