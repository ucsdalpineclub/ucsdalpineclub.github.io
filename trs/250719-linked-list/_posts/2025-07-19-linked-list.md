*Because I have my own favorite links, dammit\!*

Most of my climbing happens in California, either around San Diego or at high altitude, so these links are just stuff that I was most interested in.

**Why doesn’t anyone climb under the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway?**  
*Kristian Slolem* (stolen from supertaco, since archive doesn't work)
Back when these routes were developed and became locally popular there was an incident which, shall we say, alienated the rangers.

One of the regulars up there lived in Palm Springs. He got the idea that he could set up a beacon, a light, which he would be able to see from his house. He got his hands on one of those battery powered blinking yellow lights CalTrans used to mark out road work areas. He affixed this light to the end of a 5' long pvc pipe about 4" in diameter, such that the light shined down through the tube. He then set this beacon up in the gully a ways down the side of Kaufman Crag, aimed it best he could at his house, and turned it on.

So that night this blinking yellow light high up in the rocks near the crest was visible all over town. Naturally it was presumed to be a distress signal, and the search and rescue boys were called out. They searched high and low for the signal but since it was directed through a tube pointing away from them they could not see it. Yet they were assured from down in town that it blinked on. Eventually, after many hours, one of the SAR guys got in a position where he could see the light.

The design and set-up of the light source convinced them, quite logically, that it was a hoax meant to lure them on a wild goose chase. While this assumption was incorrect \- it was stupidity not malice \- their second conclusion was spot on: it had to be those climbers who did it. It only took one idiot to do this, but we all were suspects. I decided to lay low, I think most of us did. Sometime during that period of inattention the bolt chopping/hanger removal occurred.

I'm sure that by now any memories of this calamity are gone. Last summer Levy, Keesee and I went there with no one giving a glance at our climbing packs.
