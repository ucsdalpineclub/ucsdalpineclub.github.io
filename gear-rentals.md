This is (hopefully) going to be one of the best things about the club â€” free gear rentals!
Currently, the club owns:

* Helmet (x3)

* Grivel G1 crampons (will fit hiking boots) (x1)

* Harness (x1)

* Ice Axes (x2)

* The new Deerhorn Guidebook

Additionally, club members have some spare gear, including a spare beacon and ice axes -- ask in the chat if you would like these.

Next on our shopping list:
* 1 more pair of universal crampons
* 1 more harness
* A single trad rack
* 12x Quickdraws
* The new guidebooks for the Southern and Northern Sierra (by Roger Putnam and Vitaliy Musiyenko)
